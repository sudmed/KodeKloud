# Docker Copy Operations

The Nautilus DevOps team has some conditional data present on App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter. 
There is a container ubuntu_latest running on the same server. We received a request to copy some of the data from the docker host to the container. 
Below are more details about the task:
On App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter copy an encrypted file /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg from docker host to ubuntu_latest container (running on same server) 
in /usr/src/ location. Please do not try to modify this file in any way.
