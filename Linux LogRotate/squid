# Linux LogRotate
: '
The Nautilus DevOps team is ready to launch a new application, which they will deploy on app servers in Stratos Datacenter. 
They are expecting significant traffic/usage of squid on app servers after that. This will generate massive logs, creating huge log files. 
To utilise the storage efficiently, they need to compress the log files and need to rotate old logs. Check the requirements shared below:
a. In all app servers install squid package.
b. Using logrotate configure squid logs rotation to monthly and keep only 3 rotated logs.
(If by default log rotation is set, then please update configuration as needed)

# Install the package as per the given task
yum install -y squid

# Navigate to logrotate folder and check existing folder
/etc/logrotate.d/
cat /etc/logrotate.d/squid

# As per the task edit log file & save the file
vi /etc/logrotate.d/squid

/var/log/squid/*.log {
    monthly
    rotate 3
    compress
    notifempty
    missingok
    nocreate
    sharedscripts
    postrotate
      # Asks squid to reopen its logs. (logfile_rotate 0 is set in squid.conf)
      # errors redirected to make it silent if squid is not running
      /usr/sbin/squid -k rotate 2>/dev/null
      # Wait a little to allow Squid to catch up before the logs is compressed
      sleep 1
    endscript
}


# Start services & check the status
systemctl start squid
systemctl status squid


# Validate logs
bash /etc/cron.daily/logrotate
cat /var/lib/logrotate/logrotate.status
