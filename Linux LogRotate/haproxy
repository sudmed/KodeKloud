###  by default  there's  no haproxy.log  in /var/log
# to have these messages end up in /var/log/haproxy.log you will
# need to configure  /etc/sysconfig/rsyslog  and   /etc/rsyslog.conf

# edit  /etc/sysconfig/rsyslog:
vi /etc/sysconfig/rsyslog
   #   configure rsyslog to accept network log events.  This is done
   #    add  '-r' option to the SYSLOGD_OPTIONS  
 
# edit  /etc/rsyslog.conf:
vi /etc/rsyslog.conf
    # 1) configure local2 events to go to the /var/log/haproxy.log file
    #  Add  the following line at the end of /etc/rsyslog.conf:
    #    local2.*                       /var/log/haproxy.log
    # 2) uncomment the  following lines(s) preceded  by the line " # Provides UDP syslog reception":   
    #$ModLoad imudp                                                                                                                                       
    #$UDPServerRun 514     

# restart  rsyslog:
systemctl restart rsyslog

# Restart  haproxy  service:
systemctl restart haproxy

# check  haproxy.log again:

Handling 1 logs
rotating pattern: /var/log/haproxy.log  monthly (3 rotations)
empty log files are not rotated, old logs are removed
considering log /var/log/haproxy.log
  log does not need rotating (log has been rotated at 2021-7-31 17:0, that is not month ago yet)
not running postrotate script, since no logs were rotated
set default create context
